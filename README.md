Description:

While ANOVA and post-hoc comparison tests can produce contradictory results, the Analysis of Means (ANOM) – a method comparing treatment means to the overall mean – can simultaneously identify which treatments differ from the overall mean in a graphical approach. To address and resolve the issue of unequal variance, a two-stage sampling ANOM was developed by Nelson and Dudewicz (2002). However, this two-stage sampling procedure requires additional samples, making it less practical, especially under time and resource constraints. Therefore, under heteroscedasticity, we adapted the method into a single-stage procedure by applying Chen and Lam's (1989) approach, effectively overcoming the aforementioned drawback while maintaining control over the Type I error rate. The current development aims to expand this method from a one-way design to a more complex two-way design.
